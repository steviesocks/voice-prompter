I want you to feel the straps on your shoulders… You feel them? (gives us a beat) I want you to pack it with all the stuff that you have in your life. You start with the little things. The shelves and the drawers. The knick-knacks. Collectables. Feel the weight as that adds up. Then you start adding larger stuff. Clothes, table top appliances, lamps, linens, your TV. That backpack should be getting pretty heavy now and you go bigger. Your couch, your bed, your kitchen table. Stuff it all in there. Your car, get it in there. Your home, whether it’s a studio apartment or a two bedroom house. I want you to stuff it all into that backpack.")

You'd rather be District Five? Some stupid number?\nPeter Mark : Better than some stupid animal.\nGordon Bombay : I'll have you know, Peter, that the Duck is one of the most noble, agile and intelligent creatures in the animal kingdom.\nConnie Moreau : But they're wimpy!\nGuy Germaine : They don't even have teeth.\nGordon Bombay : Neither do hockey players. Have you guys ever seen a flock of ducks flying in perfect formation? It's beautiful. Pretty awesome the way they all stick together. Ducks never say die. Ever seen a duck fight? No way. Why? Because the other animals are afraid. They know that if they mess with one duck, they gotta deal with the whole flock. I'm proud to be a Duck, and I'd be proud to fly with any one of you. So how about it? Who's a Duck?\nFulton Reed: I'll be a duck.")
